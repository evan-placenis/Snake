# Snake
This is a recreation of a popular game called Snake. The goal of the game is to achieve a high score by using arrow keys to maneuver around the screen and collect apples (red squares) while trying to avoid hitting the edges. The catch is, each time an apple is eaten, the speed and length of the snake increases (hitting yourself also ends the game). I decided to add an element to the game by incorporating different levels of difficulty.
